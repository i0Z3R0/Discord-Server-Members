## Overview
#### This is a database of members of some large Discord servers (100k+). There are both CSV and Sqlite3 databases available. Columns include member ID, username, discrim, and their best rank in the member sidebar (e.g: High ranks are probably admins)
#### Members in the Database are **NOT** a complete list of every member, but rather most members. Read more below. 
## How is this done?
#### Members are fetched from the member list sidebar. This means in servers with over 1000 members, offline members are not fetched. Each list of members in servers are fetched every 15 minutes for several days. This captures as many online members as possible. Depending on how active a server's members are, anywhere from 5 - 75% of members can be fetched, according to my estimates. 
#### Some members may have already left, and there is no way to avoid this. 
# More Servers
#### If you want me to add a specific folder, open an issue. 
#### Several things to note before you open an issue
* The time taken will vary depending on the server. 
* Please don't submit servers with under or around 5,000 members. 
* Please include an invite link to the server. 
* If these is a reason that I can't fetch members for you, I will let you know. 
* I am not obligated to do this for you, I am doing this in my own time so please be patient and respectful.
